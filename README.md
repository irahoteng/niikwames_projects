A few projects that I am especially proud of and worked on
Summary of the Indoor Air Quality C code 
Provide user feedback of surrounding indoor air quality using gas sensor
Used to detect harmful levels of VOCs in an environment 
Organic chemicals that have a high vapour pressure at room temperature
Released by products through offgassing
Extended exposure to high VOC particle concentration can be toxic to the human body
Proportional relation to gas resistivity
A main factor that contribute to indoor air quality (IAQ)
In order to successful run this code here are the components required:
Parts required:
Arduino(UNO) 
BME680 sensor
Bread Board 
Jumper wires
Pins I used:
Used SDA,SCL,GND, &5V
My device set up:
Parts used:
(ESP8266)
BME (688)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
The ESP 8266 PINOUT
BSEC used SDA,SCL, GND and 3.3V
Implementing the LED’s 
Using GPIO’s 13-14
